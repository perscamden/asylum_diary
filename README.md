### An incomplete encapsulation

The username "Lochard" sounds similar a very offensive phrase in my first language that roughly means "very stupid". "Patrick" also sounds similar to "idiot" in my first language. It was as picked around 2 years ago when I felt something was wrong in Lithiania, not long after applied for asylum. I actually hoped the Lithuanians would tell me that they were just kidding with all the things back then. How could I have imagined it was only the beginning.

(The years-long insult and torture are backed with power abuse and impunity. They might claim their actions are nothing serious. They might be doing all these because of pettiness, but their crimes are surely not petty, not petty in scale that is. Or they might claim that I was the one causing troubles. That is knowingly twisting the facts. I regret that I ever used an apologetic tone for easing the tension, where the shameless really act as if I am the problem. They cover the crimes with further crimes and power abuse and are proud of what they do.

The number of involved people is in the hundreds, if not over a thousand.)

I left Hong Kong when I sensed dangers including my home being entered when I was away and dangers at workplaces.

Tried to volunteer for Ukraine both because I thought that we should help and because I wouldn’t be qualified for VISAs. I reckoned there could be life threatening dangers in Ukraine, but I believe there is a difference between dying for a cause and dying to/suffering persecution by authoritarians without being able to do anything. In the years that follow I got mocked a lot. “You have freedom now.”, “Captain”, “Big man”, "Baby” and various names of animal along with simpler offensive names like motherfucker.

Received no response and felt followed in Poland. Left Poland and sought asylum in Lithuania.

Started off proactively telling them my plan to establish my life in Lithuania and the problems or dangers I sensed. Turned out the authorities of Lithuania were helping the Chinese Communist Party to continue and further their persecution. Suffered harassment, insult and health damages for almost 2 years. Left when realized even the legal process for appeal was fake. Got my passport back after months of struggles but wasn’t given any documents. I refused to sign various things because those were not my actions. Check the entries for some of the details.

Got trapped in the departure area of Riga International Airport and robbed by power abuse in Latvia.

Arrived in the UK with an expiring passport and barely any money left. Couldn't reactivate a bank account I used here years ago. Claimed asylum. 

What happened in Lithuania continues in the UK.

### A few examples of what they do

Inflicting health damages. One is the damage to my respiratory system. I have become so weak that even a small change in the air or a normal movement in daily life can make me cough.

There used to be alarm in the Foreigners Registration Centre in Lithuania and Holiday Inn in the UK that would go off before I notice any smoke. But later the alarm remained silent even when there was smoke that made me cough nonstop. Not that places without alarm (or the alarm didn’t go off) were any better.

Some other health manipulations are mild diarrhoea, severe vomiting, unnatural doziness and unnatural erection. There are some others that can or cannot be found in the entries.

Fake personnels of all kinds of organization including the UN and NGOs, or real but complicit. I don’t know which is worse.

Stalking me everywhere and having phone cameras aimed at me.

They send also women not only to stalk me and aim cameras at me, but also to “walk in front of me” or do other things in front of me. Convince me that’s not sick. And it’s not just the Chinese Communist Party, but also Lithuania and the UK.

Numerous fake passersby.

Not just men and women, everything is a tool to them, including children and animals. I have kind of mentioned in some entries.

Dehumanising surveillance that enables other crimes.

Control and breach over both physical and digital mails and other forms of communication.

Collection of my image, voice and writing.

Disclosing my privacy to all kinds of people.

Fake processes and fake documents. But they are or are backed by the authorities, so...

The main diary entries are in the en/ (older) and the UK/ (more recent) folders.

It is not reader friendly as it was meant to be a record only, and an incomplete one. Maybe it is easier to read the newer entries first because they are more explicit.

Seems that I misused "drama" many times in the entries. I meant acting on a script.

I am a nobody, and this happens to me, it means it can happen to pretty much everyone.

I won't be surprised that I could be painted in many ways. You might think that I shouldn't act the way I do as an asylum seeker.

A simple fact is, I do but I didn't.

I'll specify one thing here. I tried to learn Lithuanian on my own soon after I arrived there, when there was no class. What happen THEN was that they started to pretend finally providing class. I will be fair that a small portion of the later classes was quite real. But most of the time little of exactly what I had learned by myself which they clearly knew by the dehumanising surveillance was taught in an intentional unhelpful way. It couldn't be coincidence. And that came with harassment or worse that I feared what they were truely doing. I have written the same in the entries, perhaps less explicitly back then.

They might pretend they do only some stupid things.

Those are not the only things they do.

I confidently say that I tried to offer my best. More than just as an asylum seeker. 

What I got was year long insult and torture that causes actual damages.

Even if consider only the asylum seeker part, I would have been thankful for the slightest or basic things such as a roof and simple food and I did. 

But they decided to side with the persecutors and join them in their persecution.

And then twist facts and reverse causes and results.

I don't hope that you (readers) can help me anymore. I hope only you will understand how things come to be and I hope that you can realize what gruesome things are happening in our world. How sick are those who look just the same as we are.

I don't know what we can do. But the first thing should be realising what ugly world we are living in.

My pessimistic believe is that it might already be too late and we might have little chance to change anything already.
