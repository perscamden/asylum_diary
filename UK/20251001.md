3 weeks already, I am still not allowed to get my property back. Still getting the same bullshit again and again like in the past 3.5 years.

Harassment, humiliation, further theft attempt, health problems accumulated from having to live on the street, I dare say at the end no body will take responsibility of any of these. In fact, I believe even now there are those fake cough like it's funny.

This world is doubtlessly full of sf. So many that I am doubthing how the common, or less sick, people have to live as the sickness get worse. I still haven't adjust meaningfully to cope with the sickness I have come to understand in recent years. Nor am I sure that I could ever.

To think how I went to the Eastern Europe. Worthy cause, worth my ass. I am not even seen as the same species.
